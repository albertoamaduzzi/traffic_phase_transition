# Phase transition for traffic
This description is highly incomplete and working progress...
Is a library that is build to study the phase transition to traffic whose order parameter is the fraction of people that remain trapped in the network after some limiting time, and
whose control parameter is the number of people that enter in the network per unit time (time of update for the simulator used).
In particular, tries to show the dependence of the phase transition on different regimes of polycentricity and mopmcentricity.
