Algorithm:
    Phase 0,0:
        1) Add the centers at random
        2) compute the distance matrix
        3) Compute the relative neighborhood of each vertex


evolve_street:
    For each node that is attracting:
        For each node that is attracted to attracting:
            1) Take the relative neighbor of the attracted
            if relative neighbor size = 1:
                if the attracted point is a source:
                    1) create a point pointing in direction to the relative neighbor
                    2) Add point to the graph
                    3) Add an edge
                    4) Add a road
                elif the attracting point is not a source and a growing point:
                    1) create a point pointing in direction to the relative neighbor
                    2) Add point to the graph
                    3) Add an edge
                    4) Find the point's road:
                    if the point is an intersection: 
                        1) Add a new road with all the previous points
                    else:
                        1) Add point to the existing road
