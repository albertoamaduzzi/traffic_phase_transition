Algorithm:
    General description:
        Given the set of nodes that are present in the plane, we make a first distinction:
            1) In the graph
            2) Out of graph
        We could have, in the case of multiple centers, different graphs, so, In graph of someone, could be out of the other one.
        If two vertices belong to the same class:
            C(v_i) = C(v_j), then we have the same properties.
            P_l(v_i) = P_l(v_j) (these are copies of the function C)
        However, these copies, are copies just for the starting part of the algorithm, indeed, for them to have any use, they must have a different 
        dynamic with respect of C. 
        In particular, each of the P_l can be a function that maps into any set, if bool -> Z_2, if vector<int> in N^n and so on.
        If I do not insert in the description the space of these function, they are, once initialized essentially the same objects, just copies,
        nothing could suggest me that they are different. The evolution of the system allows me to do that. 
    Phase 0,0:
        1) Add the centers at random
        2) compute the distance matrix
        3) Compute the relative neighborhood of each vertex

    For each node that is attracting:
        For each node that is attracted to attracting:
            1) Take the relative neighbor of the attracted
            if relative neighbor size = 1:
                if the attracted point is a source:
                    1) create a point pointing in direction to the relative neighbor
                    2) Add point to the graph
                    3) Add an edge
                    4) Add a road
                elif the attracting point is not a source and a growing point:
                    1) create a point pointing in direction to the relative neighbor
                    2) Add point to the graph
                    3) Add an edge
                    4) Find the point's road:
                    if the point is an intersection: 
                        1) Add a new road with all the previous points
                    else:
                        1) Add point to the existing road
