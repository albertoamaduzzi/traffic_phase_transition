    1) To investigate the optimal density(average distance) = d^(2/3)
        Optimal design of spatial distribution networks: Michael T. Gastner, M. E. J. Newman
    2) As suggests:
        Deconstructing laws of accessibility and facility distribution in cities: Yanyan Xu, Luis E. Olmos, Sofiane Abbar, Marta C. Gonz√°lez
    3) The optimality is observed just when:
        "the number of facilities (sinks) is small compared to the total number of blocks (sources) in the city "
    This recalls me the utility function in:

    U = \mu <G> + <d>
    That has got a maximum when there are a lot of sources and few sinks. (rho = d^0....) and couples of networks are used in similar ways.
