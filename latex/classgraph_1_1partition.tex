\begin{DoxyVerb}Measures of interest:
    eta_i : economic attractiviness partition i
    W_ij : jobs at partition i
    
Indices range
    i = 1,..,number_partitions
    j = 1,.., number_jobs_given_i_
Description:
    This class creates a map of partitions.
    Essentially it defines eta_i:
eta depends on different factors and can be different for different users. As different users can access informations, or can 
access to work in different ways.
The most general objject, from which we take a semplification is W_j, the wage job j offers. 
c = 1,..., average_wage.
In general I have
