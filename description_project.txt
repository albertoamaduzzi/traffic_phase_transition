The project wants to understand traffic in either a synthetically created graph or a planar graph from a real cartography.

Cities are graphs G = (V,E).
For each v in V:
    C = capacity
    n = number users
    rate_production = rate production per user each timestep

For each e in E:
    number_vehicles = number of vehicles travelling
    average_velocity = average velocity of vehicles 
    average_time_percorrence = time percorrence of vehicles
    state = 'traffic', 'free flow'
    distribution_velocities = vector of velocities [to asses this, I ]
    time_recovery = time needed to all people to have free flow










The problem here is to find some macroscopic function that will be enough descriptive what is going on at smaller scales, finer refinement.


Users can move among different edges of the graph.

For this pourpose I need to build feature rich cartography that I can use as network rich in features.
Essentially this would allow to define eta and T for economic attractivity and traffic.

The data I am using are HDX from Meta that allow to understand how many people are in different zones (hexagonal polygons.)


As cities grow, 
    A -> A'
    N_roads -> N_roads' (A)
    N_people -> N_people'
    N_jobs -> N_jobs'
